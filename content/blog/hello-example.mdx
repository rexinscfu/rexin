<AnimatedGreeting text="Hello World!" />

Welcome to the first post of our revamped blog for 2025! This is just a quick hello to test our blog system and show off some cool formatting options.

## The future is now!

It's **March 22, 2025**, and technology has never been more exciting! As we continue to see advancements in:

- Quantum computing
- Next-gen firmware interfaces
- AI-assisted hardware design
- Low-power embedded systems

The world of firmware and hardware development keeps expanding in fascinating directions.

## Some code just for fun

Here's a simple "Hello World" in different languages:

```c
// C - The classic
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, 2025!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

```rust
// Rust - Memory safe systems programming
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, 2025!");
}
```

```typescript
// TypeScript - For our web friends
const greeting = (): void => {
  const year: number = 2025;
  console.log(`Hello, ${year}!`);
  
  // Let's add some animation logic
  const element = document.getElementById('greeting');
  if (element) {
    element.classList.add('animate-bounce');
  }
};

greeting();
```

## What's coming next?

In the coming weeks, we'll be sharing:

1. Deep dives into firmware optimization techniques
2. Hardware design principles for next-gen devices
3. Tutorials on embedded Rust programming
4. Case studies from our recent projects

## Let's connect!

We'd love to hear from you about what topics you'd like us to cover in the future. Hardware design? Firmware architecture? Low-level optimization tricks?

Drop us a message and stay tuned for more content!
